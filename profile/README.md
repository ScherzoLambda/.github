# Scherzo
Playing with mathematics and logic in a computational way is great, that's why I chose to name this project `Scherzo`, which is Italian for "to play" and i like to say "scheeerrzo". But here we have serious play and technological mischief.


The purpose of this project is to bring many of my crazy software ideas to life. It's a way to leave a part of myself in this world, a contribution to humanity's knowledge and the developer community.
